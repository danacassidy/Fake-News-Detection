# Fake-News-Detection

The purpose of this notebook is to use Natural Language Processing to train a model to tell the difference between "fake" and "real" news.
The model uses AP style, a set of writing guidelines that journalists abide by, to base its determinations on whether or not an article is "real" or "fake." This model performed with 99% accuracy based on the data given.

This model allowed me to use my background as a journalist to better understand why it performed the way it did.
